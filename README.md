### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Bikeshare program will request information from the user in respect to city, month, and day of week in order to pull data from one of three files to analyze. This data will come from 3 csv files. Users are offered specific inputs and if those inputs are incorrect, the program will re-ask for a correct input.

Once inputs are selected, the program will ask the user if they would like to see the first 5 detail lines of the data for the inputs. User can view those 5, then agree to see 5 more and can continue this until all the lines have been seen or user stops.

Next the program will run metrics for most frequent times of travel, most popular stations of the trips, and finally total and average trip durations. Lastly the program will supply statistics of the bikeshare users types, genders, and birth year statistics.

Lastly the program will ask if the user would like to restart the program
